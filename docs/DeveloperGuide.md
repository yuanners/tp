## Introduction

The aim of this guide is to provide a comprehensive explanation of the internal mechanisms of MoneyGoWhere.
This will enable upcoming software engineers to acquire a detailed understanding of the application's implementation,
making it easier for them to work on the project.

For all sequence diagrams included in this guide, we will not include the interaction
with the [Parser](#glossary) and Router classes as it is implied that all inputs will first be parsed through them.

<br>
*Figure 1: Architecture diagram to illustrate the high-level design of MoneyGoWhere application.*

### Overview of components

`Main`

- Upon app launch, its sole purpose is to create an instance of `MoneyGoWhere`.

`MoneyGoWhere`

- Upon creation, it initialises and loads `Menu` and `Transaction` from [storage](#glossary) and caches them.
- On run, it initialises [`Ui`](#glossary) and `Router` and runs the following in a loop:
    - [`Ui`](#glossary) receives user input and uses `Command` to format the input so that it can be understood by the application.
    - The `Command` is then passed to the `Router` for further processing.

[`Ui`](#glossary)

- Handles the process of obtaining user input and presenting the application's output to the user.

[`Parser`](#glossary)

- Handles the process of formatting user input for the `Command`
- Handles the formatting of the `Menu` and `Transaction` components for the `Store`

`Command`

- Work closely with [`Parser`](#glossary) to ensure that user input is accurately formatted.
- Stores the necessary information in a comprehensible format that can be readily utilised across the application.

`Router`

- Given the `Command` , it identifies the appropriate function to execute.

`Validation`

- Oversees the validation process of the components within `Transaction`, `Menu`, `Payment`, or `Statistic` , ensuring
  that user input aligns with the necessary requirements.

`Transaction`

- Maintain a list of orders and its corresponding details.
- Any changes made to the list will be saved to the file defined by `Store`

`Menu`

- Maintain a list of items and its corresponding details
- Any changes made to the list will be saved to the file defined by `Store`

`Payment`

- Handles every payment and refund process for every new / existing orders in `Transaction`

`Statistic`

- This component uses the data in `Transaction` to generate the relevant performance report for the user analyse.

`Store`

- Handles the [storage](#glossary) operation of the application.

### MoneyGoWhere Component

![](./images/developersGuide/MoneyGoWhereComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 2: Class diagram for MoneyGoWhere component*

`MoneyGoWhere` is initialised by the `Main` class and have a series of job to perform.

First, its job is to initialise and maintain the instance of `Menu` and `Transaction` objects.

After initialisation, it proceed to run a loop which prompts the user for input. When it receives an input from the
user, it will invoke `Command` to stores the information in a comprehensible format.

The [`Parser`](#glossary) is a helper class that assist the `Command` object to extract and format the relevant information from the
given user input.

After the `Command` object has been successfully parsed, it will be handed over to `Router` to determine which methods
to run.

If `MoneyGoWhere` detects that the user entered the command `"exit"` , the application end the loop and terminates.

<hr>

### Menu Component

![](./images/developersGuide/MenuComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 3: Class diagram for Menu component*

The `Menu` component is a crucial part of `MoneyGoWhere`, responsible for managing and accessing all data related to
menu commands entered by the user.

Whenever a menu command is entered, the `Router` in the `MoneyGoWhere` component will pass the `Command` object to
the `Menu` component for further processing.

The `Menu` component comprises 3 main classes: `Menu`, `Item`, and `MenuAssistant`.

The `Item` class represents a specific menu item created by the user, containing its name and price.

The `Menu` class is a handy container that keeps track of all `Item` objects created by the user. It offers convenient
methods to modify the list of items and manipulate the corresponding `Item` objects.

In addition to managing and accessing all data related to menu commands, the `Menu`class also ensures that all values
passed to its corresponding methods are valid, by utilising the `Validation` component.

The `MenuAssistant` class offers a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the items in the `Menu` object.
It makes use of the `MenuAssistantUi` class to provide an intuitive and guided way for users to manage their menus.

<hr>

### Transaction Component

![](./images/developersGuide/TransactionComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 4: Class diagram for Transaction component*

The `Transaction` component is another crucial part of `MoneyGoWhere`, responsible for managing and accessing all data
related to order commands entered by the user.

Whenever a order command is entered, the `Router` in the `MoneyGoWhere` component will pass the `Command` object to
the `Transaction` component for further processing.

The `Transaction` component comprises 4 classes: `Transaction`, `Order`, `OrderEntry` and `OrderAssistant`.
Additionally, this component also have an interface `ComputeOrder` .

The `OrderEntry` class represents an item in the menu and the corresponding quantity that is required.

The `Order` class serves as a data structure that contains a list of `OrderEntry` objects along with information such as
order id, date, time and status. It also calculate the subtotal using the `ComputeOrder` interface.

The `Transaction` class act as a container, tracking all `Order` objects generated by the user, and providing methods to
add new orders to the `Order` list.

The `Validation` component is utilised by the `Transaction` class to ensure the validity of all values passed to its
methods.

The `OrderAssistant` class offers a user-friendly interface for the user to add new orders to the `Transaction` object,
leveraging the `TransactionUi` class to offer an intuitive and guided experience for users.

<hr>

### Payment Component

![](./images/developersGuide/PaymentComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 5: Class diagram for Payment component*

The `Payment` component serves as an extension to the `Transaction` component. It enables updates and modification to be
made to the status and payment type in the given `Order` object.

Whenever a pay or refund command is entered, the `Router` in the `MoneyGoWhere` component will pass the `Command` object
to the `Payment` component for further processing.

The `Payment` component comprises 4 main classes: `Payment`, `Refund`, `PaymentAssistant` and `RefundAssistant`.

When presented with both an `Order` object and the user-provided amount value, the `Payment` class takes care of
updating the order status and calculating the necessary change. This information is then displayed to the user through
the `TransactionUi` class.`

The `Refund` class searches for the user-provided order-id in the `Transaction` object's `Order` list. Once found, it
updates the status of that particular `Order` object.

The `Validation` component is utilised by both the `Payment` and `Refund` class to ensure the validity of all values
passed to its methods.

The `PaymentAssistant` and `RefundAssistant` classes provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to
perform the above-mentioned functions. By leveraging the `TransactionUi` class, these assistants offer a guided
experience for users.

<hr>

### Statistic Component

![](./images/developersGuide/StatisticComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 6: Class diagram for Statistic component*

The `Statistic` component provide reporting feature for `MoneyGoWhere` .

Whenever a report command is entered, the `Router` in the `MoneyGoWhere` component will pass the `Command` object to
the `Statistic` component for further processing.

The `Payment` component, comprises 4 main classes: `Statistic`, `SalesReport`, `RankReport`, `ItemRank`, `Chart`

The `Statistic` class is a parent class for both `SalesReport` and `RankReport` classes.

When presented with both an `Transaction` object and the user-provided date range, the `SalesReport` class filters and
generate relevant sales related report based on the transactions within the date range.

The `Chart` class uses the `StatisticUi` class to generate an intuitive bar chart from the `SalesReport` object.

When presented with the `Transaction` object, the `RankReport` class rank items in the `Menu` object based on quantity
sold or revenue made and display the results in a table using the `StatisticUi` class.

The `ItemRank` is a wrapper class that stores the name and values for the `RankReport` to compute the ranking of the
items.

The `Validation` component is utilised by `Statistic` class and its children to ensure the validity of all values passed
to its methods.

<hr>

### Store Component

![](./images/developersGuide/StoreComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 7: Class diagram for Store component*

The `Store` class facilitates the saving and loading of both `Transaction` and `Menu` objects to and from
the `./datastore` directory.

Both `Transaction` and `Menu` objects undergo JSON serialisation prior to being persisted to a file through the [`Parser`](#glossary)
component.

The [`Parser`](#glossary) component parses the JSON data retrieved from the file, converting it into either a `Transaction` or `Menu`
object.

<hr>

### Ui Component

![](./images/developersGuide/UiComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 8: Class diagram for [Ui](#glossary) component*

The `Ui` component manages the process of gathering user input and displaying the application's output to the user.

The `Ui` class encompasses all common Ui elements utilised throughout the `MoneyGoWhere` application, including the
essential function of accepting user input.

The `MenuUi` and `MenuUi` classes are responsible for menu related Ui.

The `TransactionUi` class are responsible for order related Ui

The `StatisticUi` class are responsible for statistic related Ui

The `StoreUi` class are responsible for store related Ui

The [`Flag`](#glossary) enumeration is a comprehensive collection of all error [flags](#glossary) utilised throughout the entirety of the
MoneyGoWhere application

<hr>

### Validation Component

![](./images/developersGuide/ValidationComponent.png)
<br>
*Figure 9: Class diagram for Validation component*

The `Validation` component validates user input data before processing.

Each class within the `Validation` component is dedicated to validating a specific command.

#### Add an Item

##### Advanced Mode Add an Item

The expected inputs to add only one menu item into an order is as such:

* `/additem -n <item_name> -p <price>`

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs the
command `/additem`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Item/addItem.png)

The general workflow of `/additem` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `MoneyGoWhere` then creates a new `Command` object using the user input, whose constructor invokes
   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#proRoute` which invokes `Menu#addItem`
   method to run the `/additem` command.
1. Once the command runs, `Menu#addItem` invokes `AddItemValidation#validateFlags` to check if all the required flags
   have been given.
    * If there are missing flags, a message indicating that the usage is invalid will be printed using `Ui#println` and
      control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `Menu#addItem` then invokes `AddItemValidation#validateCommand` which in turn, calls all the following validation
   method to check the arguments provided.
    * `AddItemValidation#validateArgument` checks if the user input `String` is empty
        * If the user input is empty, a message indicating that the input is empty is printed using `MenuUi#printError`
          and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
    * `AddItemValidation#validateName` checks if the given name is empty or exceeds the limit of 25 characters
        * If the name violates these naming constraints, a message indicating that the name is too short or too long is
          printed using `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
    * `AddItemValidation#validateDuplicateName` checks if the given name already exists in the `ArrayList<Item> items`
      of `Menu`.
        * If the name already exists, a message indicating that the item name already exists is printed using
          `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
    * `AddItemValidation#validatePrice` checks if the given price is empty, is not a number, is negative or has more
      than 2 decimal points
        * If any of the above is true, a message indicating the constraint that it has violated is printed using
          `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `Menu#processAddItem` is then invoked and it creates a new`Item` object using the name and price given. It then
   calls `Menu#appendItem` on the new `Item` object to add it to `ArrayList<Item> items` in `Menu`.
   Then, `Menu#save` is invoked to save the changes to the local storage file.
1. `Router` object then calls `MenuUi#printCommandSuccess` to print a message indicating that the item has been
   successfully added to the menu.

##### Basic Mode Add an Item

The expected inputs to add only one menu item into an order is as such:

* `additem`
* `1`

The sequence diagram is similar to the `Advanced Mode Add an Item`.

The general workflow of `additem` is as follows:

1. `MoneyGoWhere` then creates a new `Command` object using the user input, whose constructor invokes
   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#assistRoute` which invokes
   `MenuAssistant#addItem` method to run the `additem` command.
1. Once the command runs, it can be aborted at any time when the user inputs `/cancel`.
1. `MenuAssistant#addItem` invokes `MenuAssistant#getName` to get the name of the item to be added.
1. `MenuAssistant#getName` gets the name from the user and invokes `AddItemValidation#validateName` to check if the
   given name is empty or exceeds the limit of 25 characters and `AddItemValidation#validateDuplicateName` to check if
   the given name already exists in the `ArrayList<Item> items` of `Menu`
    * If the name violates these naming constraints, a message indicating that the name is too short or too long is
      printed using `MenuUi#printError` and re-prompts the user to enter a new name.
    * If the name already exists, a message indicating that the item name already exists is printed using
      `MenuUi#printError` and re-prompts the user to enter a new name.
1. `MenuAssistant#addItem` then invokes `MenuAssistant#getPrice` to get the price of the item to be added.
1. `MenuAssistant#getPrice` gets the price from the user and invokes `AddItemValidation#validatePrice` to check if the
   given price is empty, is not a number, is negative or has more than 2 decimal points
    * If any of the above is true, a message indicating the constraint that it has violated is printed using
      `MenuUi#printError` and re-prompts the user to enter a new price.
1. A new `Item` object is then created using the name and price given
1. `Menu#appendItem` is invoked on the new `Item` object to add it to `ArrayList<Item> items` in `Menu`.
1. The, `Menu#save` is invoked to save the changes to the local storage file.
1. `Router#assistRoute` then calls `MenuAssistant#printResult` to print a message indicating that if the item has been
   successfully added to the menu or if the user has cancelled the command accordingly.

1. `MoneyGoWhere` then creates a new `Command` object using the user input, whose constructor invokes
   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#proRoute` which invokes
   `Menu#deleteItem` method to run the `/deleteitem` command.
1. Once the command runs, `Menu#deleteItem` checks if the list of items is empty. If empty, a message indicating that
   there is nothing to be deleted using `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `Menu#deleteItem` invokes `DeleteItemValidation#validateFlags` to check if all the required flags have been given.
    * If there are missing flags, a message indicating that the usage is invalid will be printed using
      `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `Menu#deleteItem` then invokes `DeleteItemValidation#validateCommand` which in turn, calls all of the following
   validation method to check the arguments provided.
    * `DeleteItemValidation#validateArgument` checks if the user input `String` is empty
        * If the user input is empty, a message indicating that the input is empty is printed using `MenuUi#printError`
          and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
    * `DeleteItemValidation#validateIndex` checks if the given index is valid and exists
        * If the index is invalid, a message indicating the index does not exists is printed using `MenuUi#printError`
          and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `Menu#processDeleteItem` is then invoked, and it calls `Menu#removeItem` on the given index to delete it from the
   list of items. Then, `Menu#save` is invoked to save the changes to the local storage file.
1. `Router` object then calls `MenuUi#printCommandSuccess` to print a message indicating that the item has been
   successfully added to the menu.

##### Basic Mode Delete an Item

   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#assistRoute` which invokes
   `MenuAssistant#deleteItem` method to run the `deleteitem` command.
1. Once the command runs, it can be aborted at any time when the user inputs `/cancel`.
1. `MenuAssistant#deleteItem` checks if the list of items is empty. If empty, a message indicating that there is
   nothing to be deleted using `MenuUi#printError` and control is given back to `MoneyGoWhere`.
1. `MenuAssistant#deleteItem` invokes `MenuAssistant#getIndex` to get the index of the item to be deleted.
1. `MenuAssistant#getIndex` gets the index from the user and invokes `DeleteItemValidation#validateIndex` if the given
   index is valid and exists.
    * If the index is invalid, a message indicating the index does not exist is printed using `MenuUi#printError`
      and re-prompts the user to enter a new index.
1. A new `Item` object is then created using the name and price given
1. `Menu#removeItem` is then invoked on the given index to delete it from the list of items. Then, `Menu#save` is
   invoked to save the changes to the local storage file.
1. `Router#assistRoute` then calls `MenuAssistant#printResult` to print a message indicating that if the item has been
   successfully added to the menu or if the user has cancelled the command accordingly.

command `/finditem`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Item/findItem.png)

The general workflow of `finditem` is as follows:

1. `MoneyGoWhere` then creates a new `Command` object using the user input, whose constructor invokes
   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#proRoute` which invokes
   `Menu#showResultsOffFind` method to run the `/finditem` command.
1. `Menu#showResultsOffFind` will then instantiates `FindItemValidation` class to call the `validateName` method to
   ensure the item description is not empty.
1. If there is matching result, the control will pass to `MenuUi` class to print the list of matched item names.
1. If there is no matching names found, the control will pass to `MenuUi` class to print no matching item names found.

##### Basic Mode Find an Item

The sequence diagram is similar to the Advanced Mode Find an Item.

The general workflow of finditem is as follows:

1. `MoneyGoWhere` then creates a new `Command` object using the user input, whose constructor invokes
   `Parser#formatArguments` method to extract the arguments for each flag into a `Map`.
1. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#assistRoute` which invokes
   `MenuAssistant#showResultsOffFind` method to run the `finditem` command.
1. Once the command runs, it can be aborted at any time when the user inputs `/cancel`.
1. `MenuAssistant#showResultsOffFind` invokes `MenuAssistant#promptItemKeyword` to get the description of the item to be
   searched.
1. It then calls the advanced search method `Menu#showResultsOfFind` to search for the matching items.
   If there is matching result, the control will pass to `MenuUi` class to print the list of matched item names.
1. If there is no matching names found, the control will pass to `MenuUi` class to print no matching item names found.
1. `Router#assistRoute` then calls `MenuAssistant#printResult` to print a message indicating that if the item has been
   successfully found or if the user has cancelled the command accordingly.

#### Add an Order

There are three ways to add an order into MoneyGoWhere.

1. By adding only one menu item into an order
2. By adding one or more menu items into an order
3. By using Basic Mode to add one or more menu items into an order

Both ways work similarly, but are parsed differently.

This sequence diagram shows the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when a user inputs commands to
add an order.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/addOrder.png)

The next section will describe exactly how the inputs are parsed into the `addorder` command through each of the
described ways.

##### Add only one menu item into an order

The expected inputs to add only one menu item into an order is as such:

- `/addorder -i <item_index> -q <quantity>`
- `/addorder -i <substring_of_item_name> -q <quantity>`
- `/addorder --item <item_index> --quantity <quantity>`
- `/addorder --item <substring_of_item_name> --quantity <quantity>`

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs these
commands.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/addOrderValidation.png)

The general workflow of this `/addorder` command is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`
2. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which uses the `Parser` class to extract the command
   as `/addorder`.
3. The `/addorder` command gets passed back to `MoneyGoWhere` to check which function it should call.
4. `MoneyGoWhere` passes the user input to the `Order` class to create an `Order`.
5. The `Order` class passes the user input to the `AddOrderValidation` class for input validation.
6. If the input is invalid, the user will be shown an error message about the mistake made, and the correct format to
   enter the command will be shown.
7. If the input is valid, a `Payment` object will be created with the current `Order` as an input.
8. Once payment is made, the `Order` will be passed to the `Transactions` class, where this `Order` will be appended to
   the list of `Transactions`.

<hr>

##### Add multiple menu items into an order

The expected inputs to add multiple menu items into an order is as such:

- `/addorder -I [<item_index>:<quantity>,<substring_of_item_name>:<quantity>,...]`
- `/addorder -I [<substring_of_item_name>:<quantity>,<item_index>:<quantity>,...]`
- `/addorder --items [<item_index>:<quantity>,<substring_of_item_name>:<quantity>,...]`
- `/addorder --items [<substring_of_item_name>:<quantity>,<item_index>:<quantity>,...]`

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs the
command `/addorder`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/addMultipleAddOrders.png)

The general workflow of the `/addorder` command is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`
2. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which uses the `Parser` class to extract the command
   as `/addorder`.
3. The `/addorder` command gets passed back to `MoneyGoWhere` to check which function it should call.
4. `MoneyGoWhere` creates a new `Order` object and parses the user input into it as a parameter.
5. The `Order` class passes the user input to the `AddMultipleAddOrderValidation` class for input validation.
6. If the input is invalid, the user will be shown an error message about the mistake made, and the correct format to
   enter the command will be shown.
7. If the input is valid, a `Payment` object will be created with the current `Order` as an input.
8. Once payment is made, the `Order` will be passed to the `Transactions` class, where this `Order` will be appended to
   the list of `Transactions`.

<hr>

##### Basic Mode Add an Order

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs the
command `addorder` or `6`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/assistedAddOrder.png)

The general workflow of `addorder` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`
2. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which uses the `Parser` class to extract the command
   as `addorder`.
3. The `addorder` command gets passed back to `MoneyGoWhere` to check which function it should call.
4. `MoneyGoWhere` calls the `OrderAssistant` class' `assistedAddOrder` method, which continuously prompts the user for
   inputs with simple-to-follow instructions
5. If the user enters "NO" when prompted for more items to add to the order, the entire input will be formatted into the
   valid format
6. The newly formatted input will be parsed into Advance Mode's function to add multiple menu items into an order.
7. Control will be returned to `MoneyGoWhere` if the user cancels the order at any point when being prompted to add menu
   items into the order, or if the user enters "NO" when prompted, to complete the order.

#### Make payment

##### Advanced Mode Make Payment

This sequence diagram shows what happens after a valid add order command is executed.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/handlePayment.png)

The general workflow of `/pay` is as follows:

1. If the input is valid, a `Payment` object will be created with the current `Order` as an input.
2. The `Payment` object uses the `handlePayment` method to prompt the user to enter the `/pay` command with the valid
   arguments.
3. `Payment#handlePayment` then instantiates the validation class `PaymentValidation` to validate the arguments
   provided.
4. The method `PaymentValidation#validatePayment` is invoked to check the following:
    * The correct command format is used.
    * The flag for payment type and amount flags are present
    * If the payment type is by card, the payment amount must be exact
    * The payment amount is a valid 2 decimal place double and must be more than or equals to the subtotal of the order.
5. If the command passes all the validation checks, control is given back to #Payment class and the `Order.status` will
   be updated to `completed`,
   the payment type and amount are also updated accordingly and is saved to the `orders.json` file using
   the `Transaction.save` method.
6. Lastly, the control will be given back to the `Router` class and it then invokes the `Ui#printCommandSuccess` to
   print a
   message indicating that the command has executed successfully.

<hr>

#### Basic Mode Make Payment

The sequence diagram is similar to `Advanced Mode Make Payment`.

The general workflow of `pay` is as follows:

1. If the input is valid, a `Payment` object will be created with the current `Order` as an input.
2. The `Payment` object uses the `handlePayment` method to prompt the user to enter the `pay` command.
3. `Payment#handlePayment` then instantiates the assistant class `PaymentAssistant` and invoke its `makePayment` method.
4. The method `PaymentAssistant#makePayment` is invoked to check the following:
    * If the user enters `/cancel`, abort the command and return the control to `Router` class.
    * The `getAmount` and `getType` methods are called to prompt user to enter the payment amount and type, then calles
      the
      `PaymentValidation` class to validate the input:
        * If the payment type is by card, the payment amount must be exact
        * The payment amount is a valid 2 decimal place double and must be more than or equals to the subtotal of the
          order.
5. If the command passes all the validation checks, control is given back to `PaymentAssistant` class and
   the `Order.status` will
   be updated to `completed`,
   the payment type and amount are also updated accordingly and is saved to the `orders.json` file using
   the `Transaction.save` method.
6. Lastly, the control will be given back to the `Router` class and it then invokes the `Ui#printCommandSuccess` to
   print a
   message indicating that the command has executed successfully.

#### List all Orders

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs the
command `/listorder`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/listOrders.png)

Note that the work flow for both Basic and Advanced Mode is the same, and if the user input is `7` or `listorder`.

The general workflow of `/listorder` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`.
2. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which uses the `Parser` class to extract the command
   as `listorder`.
3. The obtained command is then passed back to `MoneyGoWhere`, which calls the `displayList` method in
   the `transactions` object that was initialized alongside `MoneyGoWhere`.
4. The transactions will be printed onto the console.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Refund an Order

##### Advanced Mode Refund an Order

This sequence diagram models the interaction between various components in MoneyGoWhere when the user inputs the
command `/refundorder`.

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Order/refundOrder.png)

The general workflow of `/refundorder` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which instantiates a
   new `parser` object to extract the command as `/refundorder`.
2. The 'Parser' object then uses `parser#formatInput` method from Parser class to extract all the arguments from the
   user input.
3. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command. It calls the `Router#proRoute` for the advanced mode
   commands.
4. The obtained command `refundorder` is then passed back to `MoneyGoWhere`, which instantiates a new `Refund` object
   and calls the `Refund#refundTransaction` method.
5. `Refund#refundTransaction` then instantiates the validation class `refundOrderValidation`. The
   method `refundOrderValidation#validateRefundOrder` is invoked to validate the arguments provided.
    * `refundOrderValidation#checkArgument` checks if the required argument is present. The expected argument is
      the `Order.UUID`.
    * `refundOrderValidation#checkOrder` first check if the argument is indeed a valid `Order.UUID` then checks
      the `Order.status`.
        * If the `Order.status` is already `refunded`, then the command would be invalid.
7. If the command passes all the validation checks, control is given back to `Refund` class and
   the `Order.status` will be updated to `refunded` and is saved to the `orders.json` file using
   the `Transaction.save` method.
6. Lastly, the control will be given back to the `Router` class and it then invokes the `Ui#printCommandSuccess` to
   print a message indicating that the command has executed successfully.

<hr>

##### Basic Mode Refund an Order

The sequence diagram is similar to the `Advanced mode Refund an Order`.

The general workflow of `refundorder` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which instantiates a
   new `parser` object to extract the command as `refundorder`.
2. The 'Parser' object then uses `parser#formatInput` method from Parser class to extract all the arguments from the
   user input.
3. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command. It calls the `Router#assistRoute` for the basic mode
   commands.
4. Once the command runs, it can be aborted at any time when the user inputs `/cancel`.
4. The obtained command `refundorder` is then passed back to `MoneyGoWhere`, which instantiates a new `RefundAssistant`
   object
   and calls the `RefundAssistant#refundOrder` method.
5. `RefundAssistant#refundOrder` invokes the `getID` method to get and validate the order ID to be refunded.
    * If the order list is empty, the command would be invalid.
    * If the order ID is invalid, the command would be invalid.
6. If the command passes all the validation checks, control is given back to `Refund` class and the `Order.status` will
   be updated to `refunded` and is saved to the `orders.json` file using the `Transaction.save` method.
7. Router#assistRoute then calls MenuAssistant#printResult to print a message indicating that if the item has been
   successfully added to the menu or if the user has cancelled the command accordingly.

`/report {-r sales} {-s <type} {-y <year>} {-f <start-date> -t <end-date>}`

![](./images/developersGuide/SequenceDiagrams/Statistic/createSalesReport.png)

The general workflow of `/report -r sales` is as follows:

1. User input is passed to `MoneyGoWhere`. `MoneyGoWhere` then passes it to the `Command` class, which instantiates a
   new `parser` object to extract the command as `report`.
2. The 'Parser' object then uses `parser#formatInput` method from Parser class to extract all the arguments from the
   user input.
4. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#proRoute` which invokes
   `Statistic#handleStatisticRoute` method to run the `/report` command.
5. It then instantiates the validation class `StatisticValidation` and invokes the `validateRequiredFlag` method. This
   validates the
   user input to contain all the required flags in the correct format.
6. Once the input is validated, it is passed to instantiate the `SalesReport` class.
7. The `totalSales` method is then invoked to calculate the subtotal of all the completed orders.
8. If the user input is `daily`, `Chart` class is instantiated and calls the `dailySalesChart` to generate the bar
   charts based off daily sales.
9. If the user input is `monthly`, `Chart` class is instantiated and calls the `monthlySalesChart` to generate the bar
   charts based off monthly sales.
10. Lastly, the control will be given back to the `MoneyGoWhere` class to prompt for new user input.

   user input.
4. `Router#handleRoute` is then invoked to process the command and calls `Router#proRoute` which invokes
   `Statistic#handleStatisticRoute` method to run the `/report` command.
5. It then instantiates the validation class `StatisticValidation` and invokes the `validateRequiredFlag` method. This
   validates the
   user input to contain all the required flags in the correct format.
8. If the user input is `sales`, the `rankBySales` method is invoked to rank the menu items according to total order
   sales.
    * The `StatisticUi#printSalesRankingTable` is called to print the ranking table to the console.
9. If the user input is `popular`, the `rankByPopularity` method is invoked to rank the menu items according to total
   number of order quantities.
    * The `StatisticUi#printPopularityRankingTable` is called to print the ranking table to the console.
