## Tutorial on CLI

If you're already familiar with CLI, that's great! Feel free to move on to the next section about setting up
MoneyGoWhere.

For those who are new to CLI, this section will give you a simple introduction.

So, what is CLI? Well, the device you are using needs to get instructions from you, and you might be familiar with
clicking on icons and images to send these instructions. However, with CLI, you type these instructions.

MoneyGoWhere will prompt you to enter your instructions, such as:

## Setting up MoneyGoWhere

1. Before installing and using MoneyGoWhere, do note that Java 11 is required. If you do not already have it installed,
   you can do so [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
    * For Windows users, download the x64 Installer. Ensure you are on the "Windows" page and download the correct
      version, in the red box.

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/ibRX7fQ.png)

    * For Mac users, download the ARM 64 DMG Installer.Ensure you are on the "macOS" page and download the correct
      version, in the red box.

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/DGn8lrt.png)

2. After installing Java
   11, [please download the latest release of the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/releases).
   Click on `MoneyGoWhere.jar` to automatically download the file. Ensure that it is the latest version (the one with
   the biggest number).

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/9qXdll7.png)

3. Find `MoneyGoWhere` in your Downloads folder.

4. Open `cmd` and navigate to the folder where the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file is. If you are unsure of how to do so, follow
   steps 5 to 7. Otherwise, you may skip ahead to step 8.

5. Open a command [*terminal*](#glossary) by entering `cmd` in your start menu and select the first [*option*](#glossary)
   that appears.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ezt3rky.png)

6. Get the file path of `MoneyGoWhere.jar` in your computer. To easily do so, you can do the following:

    * For Windows users, right-click the file and select the "Properties" [*option*](#glossary). Then, copy the text
      under "Location".
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/bc72Izn.png)

    * For Mac users, right-click the file and select "Copy".
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/mKfwVrc.png)

7. In the CLI, navigate to the location of the folder by typing `cd `, type or paste the file path that you found from
   the previous step by pressing CTRL and V at the same time on your keyboard, then press enter.

    * For example, if the file path that you have is `C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder`, then you should
      enter `cd C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder` into the CLI.

    <!--* This step is important as it ensures that the saved tasks file will be saved in the same directory. Otherwise, the file will be stored in the current working directory.-->

8. Use the [*command*](#glossary) `java -jar MoneyGoWhere.jar` to launch MoneyGoWhere.
   If done correctly, you will see this on your first start up:
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/xZ24DTM.png)

9. When you are done using the app, enter `exit` to shut the application down or simply close the window by clicking on
   the `X` on the top right hand corner of the CLI.

## MoneyGoWhere [Commands](#glossary)

<blockquote style="background-color:#EAF5FF; color:#364253; border-color:#3399FF; padding: 2% 3%">
üìñ Meet John! He will be a character that is constantly referenced throughout the next few sections to better explain how the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a> work. John is an aspiring hawker, and plans on running a new stall at The Deck in NUS.

</blockquote>

## Style Features

For the following sections, all examples on how to run [*commands*](#glossary) are shown in images. There are four
things
to take note of:

1. Standard text printed by the application is written in **white**.
2. User input is signified and is written in <text  style="color:#88B3F6">**blue**</text>.
3. Success messages and examples of expected output is written in <text  style="color:#7ED321">**green**</text>.
4. Error messages are written in <text style="color:#F25569">**red**</text>.

**When you use the application, the text on your screen will be in white.**

We have chosen to color-code our examples to make it easier for you to follow along and tell apart different parts of
the
examples.

Here is an example of what you can expect to see in this Guide.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MT5YgYP.png)

For those reading the **New User** sections, do also note the following:

1. At any point, if you wish to exit from the [*command*](#glossary), you can do so with `/cancel`

For those reading the **Experienced User** sections, do also note the following:

1. Any words surrounded by `<>`, such as `<price>` are for you to fill in.
2. [*Options*](#glossary) that are surrounded by `{}`, such as `{-n "<name>"}` are optional.
3. All values have to be accompanied by [*options*](#glossary) (begins with `-`, such as `-n` or `--price`). [*Commands*](#glossary) such
   as `/deleteitem delete -i 10` will be an invalid [*command*](#glossary).

## Item Features

Before you start taking orders, you will need to set up your menu. This must be done at least once.

Depending on the size of your menu, you may need to spend quite a bit of time to add all of your menu items into
MoneyGoWhere. It is important that you do this before opening shop for the day, to ensure that your business can be run
without any disruptions.

You may continue to add new items to the menu at any point of time.
<!--This should be a one-time process, but you can always add more items or remove old items at any point.-->

* [List all Items](#list-all-items)
* [Delete an Item](#delete-an-item)
* [Update an Item](#update-an-item)
* [Find an Item](#find-an-item)

## Add an Item

If you need to add an item to the menu, you can use this [*command*](#glossary). To add an item, you will need the
item's
name and price.

<h3> <strong>For New Users </strong></h3>

This example will show you how to add an item step-by-step.

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/YBkgvEQ.png)

2. He sees that he is successful and feels happy that the application is easy to use. Now, he wants to add **Egg**,
   which costs **$0.80** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/qeTaDFj.png)

3. Lastly, John uses [`listitem`](#list-all-items) to check that he has added the items correctly.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/yiScNE0.png)

<hr style="width:60%;margin:25px auto;"/>

<h3> <strong>For Experienced Users </strong></h3>

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
üí° To use the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a> in this manner, remember to add a <code>/</code> before the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a>, such as <code>/additem</code>. 
</blockquote>

**[*Command*](#glossary) Format**
These are the different [*command*](#glossary) formats that are accepted when adding a new item into the menu.

```text
/additem --name "<item name>" --price <price>
```

```text
/additem -n "<item name>" -p <price>
```

You may also interchange the location of the [*options*](#glossary) in the [*commands*](#glossary).

For example, the following [*command*](#glossary) is also valid.

```text
/additem  -p <price> -n "<item name>"
```

This example below will show you how to add an item in a single [*command*](#glossary).

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/iblVSBb.png)

2. He sees that he is successful and feels happy that the application is easy to use. Now, he wants to add **Egg**,
   which costs **$0.80** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/ARJOgRB.png)

3. Lastly, John uses [`listitem`](#list-all-items) to check that he has added the items correctly.

</blockquote>

**1. Name already exists**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow for multiple items with the same name. If you try to put in an item with the same name, you
will get the following error.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULSYB6F.png)

**Solution:** Use a different name.

<br> 

**2. Price has more than two [*decimal places*](#glossary)**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow you to enter a number with more than two [*decimal places*](#glossary). This is because
there
are no such denominations in real life.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bGhE59B.png)

**Solution:** Limit the price to 2 decimal points.

## List all Items

To see all the items you have entered in your menu, use this [*command*](#glossary)!

<h3> For Experienced Users </h3>

**[*Command*](#glossary) Format**

There are two main ways in which an order can be entered using a single `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary). Listed below are the
acceptable formats of the `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary).

1. To add a single item into an order, using the item [*index*](#glossary), by using the item name, or by using part of
   the item name,
   use any of these formats:
    ```text
    /addorder -i <index> -q <quantity>
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder --item <index> -q <quantity>
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder -i "<name>" --quantity <quantity>
    ``` 

    ```text
    /addorder --item "<name>" --quantity <quantity>
    ```
   If the quantity is not specified, it will be set to 1.

2. To add multiple items into an order using the item [*indexes*](#glossary), by using the item names, or by using part
   of the item
   names, use any of these formats:
    ```text
    /addorder -I [<index>:<quantity>,"<name>":<quantity>,...]
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder --items [<index>:<quantity>,"<name>":<quantity>,...]
    ```

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° To use the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a> in this manner, remember to add a <code>/</code> before the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a>, such as <code>/addorder</code>.
</blockquote>

Here is an example of how the `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary) may be used to add orders.

1. John enters the [*command*](#glossary) `/addorder`. He uses the [*index*](#glossary) of "Roast Chicken Rice", and enters the
   quantity.

   As his customer pays with cash, John then enters the payment information with the `/pay` [*command*](#glossary) and by entering the
   customer's payment details based on the instructions from the program.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/QCkbbcR.png)

2. For the second customer, John temporarily forgets the [*index*](#glossary) of "White Chicken Rice".

   As he knows there is only one item with "White Chicken" in the name, he enters that as the first item, along with the
   quantity.

   Then, he uses the [*index*](#glossary) of "Egg", along with the quantity. After adding both items, he proceeds to
   enter the payment.

   This time, the customer chose to pay by card, which John enters into the application to reflect that mode of payment.

**1. Insufficient cash**

This error message will appear when the customer attempts to pay an amount less than the total cost of their order.

When your customers pay with their card, entering an amount different from the subtotal will be rejected.

**1. Wrong order ID.**

If you entered an invalid or non-existent order ID, MoneyGoWhere will not recognise it.

**Solution:** Copy the order ID directly from `listorder` and paste it to ensure there are no errors.

 <br><br>
2. For the month of January, which were ordered the most?

Don't worry if you find yourself still confused by the format. We admit, it is pretty complex. So, let's break it down:

**Rank vs Sale**
Of the two, only one can be present in your [*command*](#glossary).

* When generating your report, you can choose between the [*options*](#glossary) `rank` or `sale`.
    * Rank orders the items on your menu based on either `sales` (monetary income) or `popular` (quantity ordered).
    * Meanwhile, Sale shows your income, either on a `daily` basis or `monthly` basis.

**Year vs From/To**
Of the two, only one can be present in your [*command*](#glossary).

* You can choose which dates to generate the report.
    * Year takes the format `YYYY`
    * From/To takes the format `DD/MM/YYYY`

<blockquote style="background-color:#EAF5FF; color:#364253; border-color:#3399FF; padding: 2% 3%">
üìñ  Now, we will show you how John was able to use this [*command*](#glossary) to achieve his goals. 
</blockquote>

1. John indicates the `rank` [*option*](#glossary) to be `sales`, and the `year` to be `2023`.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/5QhmPmq.png)

2. John indicates the `rank` [*option*](#glossary) to be `popular`, and the date range to be from `01 Jan 2023`
   to `31 Jan 2023`.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/3bVzNuc.png)

3. Now, he wants to look at his monthly sales report for 2023. He indicates the `sale` [*option*](#glossary) to
   be `monthly` and
   enters `2023` for the `year` [*option*](#glossary).

   Note that the remaining months have been removed as they are all empty.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/gCxyEhW.png)

4. Lastly, he wants to check his daily sales report for the first 10 days of March 2023. He indicates the `sale` [*option*](#glossary)
   to be `daily` and enters the date range `01/03/2023` to `10/03/2023`.

**1. Generating a Montly Sale report with From/To**

This happens when you try to generate a montly sale report without using the `year` [*option*](#glossary).

![](https://i.imgur.com/RNe0j66.png)

**Solution:** When generating a monthly sale report, use the `year` [*option*](#glossary).

**2. Wrong Date Format**

This happens if you enter the wrong format for the date, such as using `-` instead of `/`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BWY4U4X.png)

**Solution:** Use the correct format of `DD/MM/YYYY`.

The list of items and orders and stored as individual `json` files. While can edit these files, the team behind MoneyGoWhere advises against doing so as you may corrupt your file. Should any changes need to be made directly on the file, you may reach out to us, and we'll be happy to help.  -->

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** I'm switching to a new laptop. Do I need to re-enter all the items on my menu? And what about my transactions?

**A:** Don't worry! At MoneyGoWhere, we understand that you may change the laptop you use. When changing to a new
laptop, simply copy the entire folder! This way, the application and all your data will stay the same across devices.

**Q:** Where is my save file?

**A:** Your menu and transaction list are stored in a folder called `datastore`. Inside it, you should see two
files: `menu.json` and `orders.json`. However, all changes to your data should be made through the application itself,
as we are not liable for any data loss as a result of tampering with those files.
